# Alenka
#### A Visualization System for Bio Signals
***

See the Wiki on GitHub for [build instructions](https://github.com/machta/Alenka/wiki).

Other resources, like sample input files and a Linux VB image with everything preinstalled (for Win XP users, or if you just don't know how/want to install OpenCL on your machine), are available [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqUIh0ej0P_gsRvTNw_08HhKV3dr).

### Requirements
* git
* cmake 3.1 (for Ubuntu 14 download the latest version)
* C++14 compiler: gcc, clang, or Microsoft Visual C++ 2015
* Qt 5.9.5 (gcc/MSVC and QtCharts module)
* OpenCL 1.2
* OpenGL 2.0
* Matio library

If your device doesn't support OpenCL (e.g. when running a Linux guest in VirtualBox), use AMD APP SDK for a CPU implementation of OpenCL.
